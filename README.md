# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze data to help Louise make more informed decisions by giving her a better understanding of how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch daes and their funding goals.
### Purpose
We performed our analysis by utilizing reporting from Theater Outcomes by Launch Dates and also by the actual outcomes based on goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
We narrowed our scope of data to Theater. We were able to examine all successful, failed, and cancelled outcomes related to launch dates. We were able to total all outcomes as well as sort them by month.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We  narrowed our scope of project outcomes based on their fundraising goals. We utilzed multiple goal ranges and were able to sub-categorize the outcomes to specific ranges. We gave further analysis by utilizing percentages related to outcomes.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I had challenges with specific formula coding when pulling multiple column data.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We were able to utilize our data to support Louis's decision making ability.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The launches were more successful during the late spring and summer months as opposed to the winter months. In december the number of successful and failed outcomes were most nearly equal.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful outcomes by percentage were funraising goals of less than $1000.00. The higher the goal was the more likely it was to fail. There were three goal ranges where the outcome was nearly the same percentage for both success and failure. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset doesn't allow us to best visualize the outcomes.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I belive a pie or bar chart would lend us better visualization in order to capture the trends.
